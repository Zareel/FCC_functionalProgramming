//* Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs

/*
Fill in the urlSlug function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL. You can use any of the methods covered in this section, and don't use replace. Here are the requirements:

The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words

The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)

The output should be all lower-cased letters

The output should not have any spaces

// Only change code below this line
function urlSlug(title) {
  return title
    .toLowerCase()
    .split(" ")
    .filter((item) => item != "")
    .join("-");
}
// Only change code above this line
console.log(urlSlug("A Mind Needs Books Like A Sword Needs A Whetstone"));
